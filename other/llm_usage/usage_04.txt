The LaTeX-related error messages you're seeing, particularly the ! Missing $ inserted. error, often occur when LaTeX is expecting a mathematical environment (like align, equation, or inline math using $) but finds something else instead. This can happen if there are unescaped special characters or improper use of math environments in your R Markdown or LaTeX document.

Troubleshooting Steps
Check for Special Characters: Ensure that any special characters in your text (like $, %, _, etc.) are properly escaped with a backslash (\) when they are not intended for LaTeX math environments.

Review Your Code: Look closely at the line mentioned in the error (line 528 in your document) to identify if there's a math mode context that wasn't closed properly.

Ensure Proper Use of Math Mode: If you're using mathematical notation, make sure that it’s enclosed in $...$ for inline math or $$...$$ for display math.

Suggested Fixes in Your R Code
Since the error seems to be related to LaTeX rendering in an R environment (possibly during the use of kable or kable_styling), here are a few adjustments to your R code to ensure it runs smoothly:

Remove any LaTeX-related output that may interfere: If you're using LaTeX for output, make sure you are not including extra dollar signs in the table captions or elsewhere unless you're intending to use them for math.

Adjust your kable call: Ensure your captions and column names don't include LaTeX characters unless they are properly formatted. Here’s an example modification of your existing code:

r
复制代码
# Display first 5 rows without extra styling
weighted_predictions %>%
  head(5) %>%
  kable(
    col.names = c("State", "Candidate Name", "Weighted Percentage", "Total Weight"),
    caption = "Weighted Predictions with Recency Adjustment",
    booktabs = TRUE  # Keep this as is
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down", "hold_position"), 
                position = "center")
Check your R Markdown document: If you're knitting an R Markdown document to PDF or using LaTeX directly, ensure that all LaTeX math expressions are properly formatted. For example:
markdown
复制代码
# In R Markdown
## Example Table

Here is the summary table:

$$
\text{Weighted Predictions with Recency Adjustment}
$$
Summary
If you still face issues after checking these points, please review the specific line indicated in the error and the surrounding context to ensure that all LaTeX environments are properly closed and formatted. If the problem persists, you may want to provide more context or the specific line that causes the issue for more targeted assistance.

The error log you provided indicates a couple of potential issues in your LaTeX document related to font scaling and missing math mode indicators. Let's break down the log and address the issues step by step:

Analyzing the Log
Font Scaling Messages:

The log entries starting with LaTeX Font Info are informational messages indicating that LaTeX is adjusting the font sizes. These messages are typically not problematic but indicate that the fonts may not be exactly what was requested.
Missing $ Inserted Error:

The critical part of the error is ! Missing $ inserted. This means LaTeX expected a math environment to start but found something else. This usually happens when you have text or math notation that isn’t correctly formatted.
Line Numbers:

The error references l.528, which indicates the specific line where the issue occurs. You should examine this line closely, especially for any unbalanced math environments or improperly placed dollar signs.
Common Causes and Fixes
Unmatched Dollar Signs:

Ensure every dollar sign ($) has a corresponding closing dollar sign. If you start a math environment with $, it must end with another $.
Improper Text in Math Mode:

Ensure that any text you want to include in math mode (like variable names or functions) is correctly formatted. For instance, use \text{} to include regular text within math mode:
latex
复制代码
\text{Your text here}
Check for Line 528:

Look at line 528 in your document and surrounding lines. Ensure there’s no stray $ or math symbol outside of a valid environment.
Suggested Code Review
Here’s how you might adjust your R code to ensure it handles LaTeX formatting correctly:

r
复制代码
# Display first 5 rows without extra styling
weighted_predictions %>%
  head(5) %>%
  kable(
    col.names = c("State", "Candidate Name", "Weighted Percentage", "Total Weight"),
    caption = "Weighted Predictions with Recency Adjustment",
    booktabs = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped", "scale_down", "hold_position"))
LaTeX Document Adjustment
In your LaTeX document, ensure that:

All math is enclosed in either $$...$$ for display or $...$ for inline.
Regular text is not placed within math environments unless properly formatted.
Example of Proper LaTeX
Here’s a simple example of properly formatted LaTeX that avoids these issues:

latex
复制代码
\begin{align*}
\text{Weighted Predictions} &= \theta \cdot \text{days\_to\_election}_{ijk} + \eta \cdot \text{sample\_size}_{ijk} \\
&= \delta \cdot \text{pct}_{ijk}
\end{align*}
